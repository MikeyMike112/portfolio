# Technical writing portfolio

As a Technical Writer, I create and enhance user documentation for topics such as drivers, databases, and data migration.
I conduct research interviews with developers, test software, update documentation in various formats, and contribute to GitHub repositories to improve the user experience and satisfaction.

I have a Master's degree in English Language and Literature/Letters from the University of Rhode Island and a dual B.A. in English and Spanish from Tulane University.
I have also worked as a Web Content Editor for the Tulane ByWater Institute and A Studio in the Woods, where I wrote, revised, and published digital content for their websites and social media channels, and assisted with fundraising and event coordination. 
I have a passion for writing, editing, and communicating complex technical information in a clear and engaging way.
My goal is to continue learning and growing as a Technical Writer and to deliver high-quality documentation that meets the needs of the users and the organization.

## Docs as code vs word processors

Not all businesses write documentation in the same way.
Some companies use AsciiDoc, Dita, or other "docs as code" options in order to optimize collaboration and version control.
Other companies may choose traditional word processesors such as Microsoft Word or Google Docs.

To accommodate different styles of documentation, this page provides links to my work in both formats.

## Documentation as code

In my most recent project at DataStax, I had the opportunity to contribute to our user's success by collaborating with a subject matter expert who provided me with tested sample code. From there I used AsciiDoc with Antora to write, format, and publish five driver quickstart guides. These instructions are for users looking to connect and migrate data from their application to a DataStax Astra database.

These guides cover a range of programming languages, including Python, Node.js, Java, C++, and C#, and serve a crucial role in connecting applications to databases.

For an insight into my approach and the quality of my work, I invite you to explore the following quickstart guides, a recent example of my efforts to enhance user understanding and engagement:

* [Node.js driver quickstart](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/astra-db-vector/drivers/nodejs-quickstart.html)
* [Java driver quickstart](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/astra-db-vector/drivers/java-quickstart.html)
* [C++ driver quickstart](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/astra-db-vector/drivers/cpp-quickstart.html)
* [C# driver quickstart](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra/astra-db-vector/drivers/csharp-quickstart.html)

## Software documentation using the Google Suite

During my time working as a government contractor for the Department of Defense, I was unable to disclose any of my work publicly.
To showcase my writing abilities during that time, I sat down with an engineer who explained PivotTables to me, a feature in Microsoft Excel, in order to showcase my writing style.

See my [Introduction to PivotTables](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P0K-FJbFzDb20aj6VB-8yF0m2lvdqp4Hy6kH7JVRRh0/edit) for a comprehensive understanding of my documentation approach outside of a docs-as-code environment.
